Often it is difficult to build upon and learn from another individualâ€™s code and it is critical to have as much
information as possible to build and use the program so that you can utilize or improve the software. Some of the greatest
scientific minds have created software that often lays dormant, and has flawed or no metadata to assist in any future endeavors
to utilize the software. Software curation involves maintaining, preserving and adding value to legacy research software. For
legacy code still in active development, there are countless challenges to be faced in modifying and implementing changes
especially for outdated or large scale scientific projects. Digital curation and data preservation are influenced by a desire to
share with the wider research community. Necessary actions are required to promote curation and preservation of legacy
programs especially in regards to national entities like the Department of Energy. We outline our approach to extending
the lifetime of this software in two forms: shelved/dormant software and software that is still in active development
