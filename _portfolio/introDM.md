Scientific literature relating to the biomedical sciences can typically be reproduced through a 
comprehensive understanding of a papers four rhetorical elements: Data, Methods, Software and Findings. 
While a scientific article is not necessarily structured with these 4 subtopics in mind, the DMSF information
is essential to properly and efficiently recreate an accurate summarization of a papers results. In taking a 
machine learning approach of extracting these essential aspects from a medical paper, the clear first step 
involves classifying the body of the article into these 4 categories. With sentences properly classified 
and grouped according to type, further semantic analysis and data mining can be more easily performed. For 
example, techniques to summarize these elements would be more effective when aggregating like-minded sentences
and providing a summary for each rhetorical category, rather than one summary attempt for entire text body.
